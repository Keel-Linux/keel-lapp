# Boot test of this stack (org-plan section 1), modelled on the ones in
# keel-nodebb, keel-mariadb, keel-postgresql and keel-apache-php: assemble the
# published layer chain into an LXC rootfs, boot it headless from the instance
# description, wait for the first boot to finish, then ask the machine for
# what the stack is for.
#
# It runs against either artefact of this recipe and is told which by the
# appliance name:
#
#   tests/boot-test.sh lapp           the stack with a local database server
#   tests/boot-test.sh lapp-client    the stack whose database is elsewhere
#
# What it proves of both, all of it over the container's global IPv6 address,
# because IPv6 first is the default this project builds for and a test written
# against 127.0.0.1 would pass on a stack that answers only on IPv4:
#
#   Apache answers on 80 and on 443 for the appliance's own page,
#   PHP executes, rather than the page coming back as source text,
#   the appliance's page carries the mark and the mark is served,
#   the CGI handler runs the Perl script under /var/www/cgi-bin,
#   Adminer answers on its own port, 12322,
#   the Webmin module the artefact is held to is installed and Webmin
#     answers on 12321,
#   and keel diff reports no drift against the description that was declared.
#
# Then the one question that differs between the artefacts, which is the
# reason there are two of them:
#
#   lapp          the database answers on ::1 and on 127.0.0.1 with the
#                 password the instance description declared,
#   lapp-client   there is no local database server: no package, no data
#                 directory, nothing listening on 3306 and no process.
#
# This proves the stack rather than the ports. A web stack that answered 200
# on every port and could not reach a database would pass a port test and fail
# the operator on the first page they wrote.
#
# Called by the reusable workflow test-appliance.yml after keel pull and keel
# verify; runnable by hand as root on any host with LXC, see tests/README.md.
# It builds nothing: the layers come from the mirror or from a directory
# bt-layer wrote, so the test needs no fab, deck or buildtasks. The logic lives
# in tests/lib/boot-test-lib.sh and is unit tested; this file is the thin main
# that touches the system.
