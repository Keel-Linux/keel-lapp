# answers with the declared secret; lapp-client is asked to prove it has no
# server at all, which is the reason that artefact exists and would be the
# most expensive failure to ship unnoticed.
#
# Nothing here starts a
# container, writes outside a path it is given or opens a socket. The two
# functions that run a command, bt_now and bt_container_ipv6, take it from
# the environment or from PATH so a test can replace it. Sourced by

usage: tests/boot-test.sh APPLIANCE [options]

Assembles the layer chain of APPLIANCE into an LXC rootfs, boots it headless,
waits for the first boot to finish, and asks the container over IPv6 for what
the stack is for. APPLIANCE is one of the two artefacts of this recipe:

  lapp          Apache, PHP and a local PostgreSQL server
  lapp-client   the same stack with no local server, for the database that
                lives somewhere else

Of both: Apache on 80 and on 443, PHP executing rather than being served as
text, the appliance's own page carrying the mark, the CGI handler, Adminer on
12322, the Webmin module the artefact is held to, Webmin on 12321, and keel
diff reporting no drift. Then the one question that differs: lapp is asked
whether the database answers on ::1 and 127.0.0.1 with the declared password,
and lapp-client is asked to prove it has no database server at all.

The instance description defaults to tests/instance.yaml for lapp and
tests/instance-client.yaml for lapp-client. Root only.
