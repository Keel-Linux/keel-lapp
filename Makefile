# keel-lapp: LAPP, built as a child of the apache-php layer with PostgreSQL
# carried as a fab unit. Compatible with TurnKey Linux appliances: this is
# turnkeylinux-apps/lapp, recomposed so that the web half is the layer LAMP
# also builds on and the database half is a component rather than a parent.
#
# This file is keel-lamp's, with the database named differently. If the two
# ever diverge in anything else, that difference is the argument for or
# against the whole composition and belongs in the pull request rather than
# in a comment; README.rst lists the two places they differ today and why.
#
# Two artefacts come out of this one recipe, and they differ by exactly one
# thing: whether unit.d/postgresql is present in the product directory.
#
#     # the stack with a local database server
#     git clone --branch v1.0.0 \
#         https://github.com/keel-linux/unit-postgresql.git unit.d/postgresql
#     bt-layer lapp --parent apache-php
#
#     # the same recipe with no unit cloned: no server in the image
#     bt-layer lapp-client --parent apache-php
#
# Decision 0013 is why the split is by content and not by topology. An image
# is never split by standalone, primary or replica: those differ by
# configuration and the console changes them. An image is split when the
# content differs, and a stack with a local database server and one without
# are genuinely different images. The names say what is in them: lapp has the
# server, lapp-client has the client and reaches a server somewhere else.
#
# Nothing below asks which of the two is being built by name. The recipe reads
# its own content instead, and conf.d/main asks dpkg what was actually
# installed rather than trusting the variable, which is traps.md's "asserting
# the configuration is not asserting the behaviour".

# The database component. fab resolves its plan with ours, applies its overlay
# and runs its conf script, and bt-layer records it in the layer manifest as
# "units postgresql@<version>", so a layer built on this one does not run that
# conf script a second time. Absent, the wildcard is empty and this is the
# artefact with no local server.

HAS_DB_SERVER := $(if $(wildcard $(UNIT_DIRS)/postgresql),yes,no)

# Everything the finished image is made of is declared here, including what
# the parent already applied. bt-layer subtracts the parent's list and applies
# only the difference, and records the full list in the manifest so that a
# layer built on this one can subtract in its turn. A recipe that declared
# only its own additions would build correctly and leave its children
# re-running the parent's conf scripts.
#
# The first four are the web stack, which is exactly what apache-php carries,
# so bt-layer subtracts all four.
